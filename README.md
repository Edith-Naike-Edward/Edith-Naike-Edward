- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Edith-Naike-Edward
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, UX/UI design and data science.
- ðŸŒ± I have a strong background in CSS, C, C++, and JavaScript. I'm currently expanding my knowledge by learning Spring Boot, and I'm excited to see where this new skill will take me. In the past, I've also had experience working with Python, which has helped me develop a well-rounded skillset. I'm always eager to keep learning and growing as a developer, and I'm confident that my diverse experience will allow me to tackle any challenge that comes my way.
